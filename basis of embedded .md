# EMBEDDED SYSTEMS
- embedded system is a cobiantion of hardware and software.
- software that running on hardware is called filmware.
- embedded device is heart of all devices.
- some examples which are related to embedded systems are ,Electronic Toys, Mobile Handsets, Washing Machines, Air Conditioners etc..
## Embedded systems classifications based on generation
- There are four generations these are devoloped based on their performance and the usage.
### First generation.
- The early embedded systems built around 8-bit microprocessors like 8085 and Z80 and 4-bit microcontrollers.
- examples: Digital Telephone Keypads.
### second generation.
- Embedded Systems built around 16-bit microprocessors and 8 or 16-bit microcontrollers, following the first generation embedded systems.
- examples:  Data Acquisition Systems.
### Third generation
- Embedded Systems built around high performance 16/32 bit Microprocessors/controllers, Application Specific Instruction set processors like Digital Signal Processors (DSPs).
- examples: robotics and networking.
### fourth generation.
- Embedded Systems built around System on Chips (SoCâ€™s), Reconfigurable processors and multicore processors.
- examples: smatrphones,MIDs
- in the hardware point of view there are three main devices which are capable of running instructions and executing.
### They are:
- **micro-controllers.**
- **micro-processors.**
- **soc's(system on chips).**
### Micro-controllers.
- micro controller is nothing but a small integrated circuit that functions as a miniature computer, designed to controll specific tasks within the electronic devices.
- examples: engine control,ABS system,washing machine,micro ovens,telivision remote
- these are designed to handle single core process.
- these are capable of running instructions and executing
- we can also call it as MCU.
- the typical micro controllers consists of processor core volatile and non-volatile memory.
 ### Micro Controller also include
- A processor that runs instructions
- Memory to store programs and data.
- Input/output ports to connect with buttons,sensors,screens,etc.
- Communication ports(to connect with other devices).
## USES OF MICRO CONTROLLER IN EMBEDDED SYSTEMS 
1. Security systems
2. Laser printers
3. Automation system
4. Robotics.
# MICRO-PROCESSORS
- A micro processor is a programmable device that takes in input,performs some arithemetic and logical operations over it.
- A central processing unit(CPU) on a single integrated circuit(IC) chip.
- It is measaured in megahertz(MHz) or gigahertz(GHz)
### Basic terms used in the microprocessor.
1. **Instruction set:** instructionn set is a group of instructions in the microprocesses which can be executed. it is the interface between hardware and software.
2. **Bus:** busses are used to carry data,address and control information within a microprocessor.these are three types of busses which are data bus,address bus , control bus.
3. **IPC(instruction per cycle):** it is measured as the number of instructions that a cpu can execute in a single clock cycle.
4. **clock speed**: it refers to the number of operations can perform per second.
5. **data types:** it supports various formats such as binary,ASCII,signed bits and unsigned bits.
## Application of Microprocessor
- **computer**: the microprocessor are the cpus in the computers.
- **embedded system**: it is utilized as the main processing block in the embedded systems such as washing            machines,microwaves and other equipments.
- **industrial automation**: it can be used to control industrial machinery and equipments.
## Uses of Micro Controller in Embedded systems
1. Industrial automation: microprocessor control robots,assembly lines and other automated process in a factories, ensuring efficiency and precision.
2. home appliances: from the washing machines and refrigerators to microwaves ovens and smart thermostats,microprocessors manage the functionality and user interface of everyday house hold devices
3. automotive systems: modern vehicles rely heavily on microprocessors for rnginr management,anti lock braking systems(ABS),air bags, infotainment system and more
4. medical devices: microprocessors play a crucial role in medical equipment like mri machine monitoring systems , and diagnostics tools, enabling accurate and reliable operation
