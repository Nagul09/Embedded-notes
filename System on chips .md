# System on chips
- SoC's designed by the combining some of the best features of Microprocessor and Microcontroller.
- it is a single integrated circuit (IC) that combines all or most of the components of a computer or electronic system onto one chip
### Key features and benfits of SoC's:
1. **integration:** SoCs integrate various components, such as the CPU, GPU, memory, and other peripherals, onto a single chip, leading to a smaller and more compact design.
2. **reduced power consumption** By integrating components and using optimized power management circuits, SoCs consume less power, making them ideal for battery-powered devices.
3. **improved performance:** SoCs offer faster data transfer speeds and overall improved performance due to the close proximity of components
4. **cost-effectiveness:** Manufacturing a single chip is generally more cost-effective than producing multiple discrete components
### common applications of SoC's:
- **smartphones and tablets** SoCs are essential for powering mobile devices, offering high performance and power efficiency in a compact design
- **internet of things(IoT) devices:** SoCs are widely used in IoT devices, such as smart thermostats and sensors, requiring compact size and low power consumption
- **automotive industry:** SoCs enable advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), infotainment systems, and electric vehicle charging stations
- **consumer electronics:** SoCs are used in a wide range of consumer electronics, including wearables, smartwatches, and other gadgets
- **industrial automation:** SoCs are used in various industrial automation systems,such as manufacturing automation and control systems.
### Uses of SoC:
- used in smartphones,smartwatches,tablets and computers.
- Internet of things applications such as home automation.
- embedded system applications especially where the microcontroller is used.
