# Differences between Microcontrollers and Microprocessors
| Microcontrollers | Microprocessors|
|------------------|----------------|
| Microcontrollers has memory ,a cpu,and I/O | Microprocessor only consists of Central Processing Unit |
| Since memory and I/O are present together, the internal circuit is small in size | Since memory and I/O are connected externally, the circuit becomes large in size |
| It can be used in compact systems | It cannot be used in compact systems |
| cost is low | Cost is high |
| Microcontroller speed is measured in terms MHz | Micro processor speed is measured in terms of GHz|
| at 12MHz speed Microcontroller executes instructions | Most of the Microprocessors are running at 1GHz speed|
| These are running at less than <100MHz | Microproceesor runs at above 1GHz to 6GHz|
